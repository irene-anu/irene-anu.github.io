                <h4>Comtemporary Scottish Food</h4>
                <img src="images/ubiquitous_chip.jpg" alt="Ubiquitous Chip" style="width:50%; height: 250px;">
                <p>The Chip (as it's known locally) has been a Glasgow institution since 1971 - and they’ve not let standards slip yet.
                    From doorstop sandwiches for lunch to refined Scottish food for dinner, you’ll find something for every meal of the day at this Ashton Lane legend - and taking a seat among the ferns and climbing plants of the courtyard restaurant is something of a do-before-you-die moment, in Glasgow west end terms.
                    The Ubiquitous Chip’s own venison haggis - made in-house - calls to us, but you’re guaranteed a good feed no matter which menu you’re looking at, from brasserie breakfast to full-on celebration meal.</p>

                <h3>Paesano</h3>
                <h4>Traditional Napoletana Pizza</h4>
                <img src="images/paesano.jpg" alt="Paesano" style="width:50%; height:250px;">
                <p>Without doubt Glasgow's most popular pizza joint, the queues outside Paesano continue to appear almost five years since this much-loved Miller Street venue first threw open its doors.
                    Fresh ingredients, a simple menu and a team of Neapolitan specialists are the reasons why this Merchant City restaurant is so revered.
                    Such is its success, Paesano West End soon followed in 2017, while Sugo - Paesano's pasta cousin - opened late last year.</p>

                <h3>Beirut Star</h3>
                <h4>Authentic Lebanese Food</h4>
                <img src="images/beirut_star.webp" alt="Beirut Star" style="width:50%; height: 250px;">
                <p>You’ve tried Lebanese food before, even if you didn’t recognise it - but you’ve never had shawarma, falafel or creamy humous like that on offer at Beirut Star in Cessnock.
                    The takeaway counter is often queued around the block since word got out about the not-so-hidden gem - but you can sit in if you fancy ordering up a feast to share (or not, we’re not judging).
                    If we give you one scrap of menu advice, it’s this: try the mutabbal (baba ghanouj) with as much flatbread as you can grab. Snatch it from the hands of your beloved if you must. Then thank us later - because it's utterly glorious.</p>
